# Foundation - Pelotech's GitOps K8s Cluster
Foundation is our repository of base, reusable manifests for setting up GitOps k8s clusters, currently targeted for AWS EKS. ArgoCD is installed as the GitOps agent in a self-managed fashion and also includes Pelotech's set of opinionated components to solve everything that K8s doesn't out of the box (DNS/TLS, storage, logs/metrics etc.)
